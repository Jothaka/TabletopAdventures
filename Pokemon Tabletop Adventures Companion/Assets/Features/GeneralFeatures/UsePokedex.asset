  Target: A Pokemon not yet identified by your Pokedex within 10m
  Trigger: 
  FeatureEffect: By pointing your Pokedex at the unidentified Pokemon, your Pokedex
    identifies a Pokemon. Since Pokemon can be differently shaped and colored despite
    being the same species, the Pokedex takes a moment to analyze the screenshot made
    with its eye and give you the information 12 seconds later, or two rounds of combat
    later. For every 40 Pokemon you identify with your Pokedex, your Trainer Levels
    Up!
