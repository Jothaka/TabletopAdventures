  Trigger: "Your Pok\xE9mon uses a move with the Weather keyword"
  FeatureEffect: "Every 15 levels gained, you may perform this Feature another time
    per day.\nThe target\u2019s Weather does not affect the entire field, and does
    not replace any existing Weather conditions. Instead, your Pok\xE9mon targets
    a space within 6 meters of itself. From that space originates a Blast with a radius
    of up to 4 meters, though it may be smaller if you wish. Your Weather Move affects
    only this area, and acts as normal within this area."
