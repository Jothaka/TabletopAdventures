  FeatureEffect: "Every 5 levels gained, you may perform this Feature another time
    per day.\nWhen using moves with the Wall keyword, instead of creating a Wall,
    your Pok\xE9mon creates a Coat with the wall\u2019s effect. This effect has a
    single target, and your Pok\xE9mon may target itself or others with this effect.
    These Coats last until the end of the encounter, or until the target is recalled."
