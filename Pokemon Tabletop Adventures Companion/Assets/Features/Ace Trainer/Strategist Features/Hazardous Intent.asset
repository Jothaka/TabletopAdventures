    an additional X meters of Hazards, where X is your ATK modifier. You may place
    Hazards as you like within your range, and each meter of hazards need not be adja-cent
    to another. If you put Hazards in a square occupied by an enemy, they immediately
    suffer the effects of the Hazard upon Shifting."
