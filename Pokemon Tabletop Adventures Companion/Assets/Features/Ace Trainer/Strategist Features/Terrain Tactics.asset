  FeatureEffect: "Your Pok\xE9mon with the Fountain, Freezer, Groundshaper, Materializer,
    or Sprouter\r\nSkills may, instead of performing a Move on its turn, target up
    to X square meters within 6 meters, turning the targeted spaces into Rough Terrain.
    X is equal to half your ATK Modifier plus the Pok\xE9-mon\u2019s Power or Intelligence
    Skill, whichever is higher. This ability may be limited by the targeted ter-rain;
    for example, while a Pok\xE9mon with Fountain could turn dirt into mud to create
    rough terrain, it may not be able to create rough terrain when fighting on concrete.\r\nVersatility
