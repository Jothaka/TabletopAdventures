  FeatureEffect: You may sleep and have just as much awareness to sound, feeling,
    and smell as if you are awake. You also instinctively sense danger while asleep
    and can wake up instantly. If you have the sta-tus affliction Sleep, treat it
    as normal non-status afflicted sleep. You do not need to make perception checks
    with a penalty while asleep.
