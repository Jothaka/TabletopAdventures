    Pok\xE9mon cannot use the Moves Endeavor, Explosion, Flail, Pain Split, Reversal
    or Self-destruct while they have 0 HP or less. You may still return a Pok\xE9mon
    with 0 or less HP and send out a Pok\xE9mon in the same action. Pok\xE9mon with
    the Soulless ability cannot benefit from Press On! This does not change when your
    Pok\xE9mon need to make death savings throws."
