  FeatureEffect: "When Pok\xE9mon or trainers try to flee during an encounter that
    you are participating in and their movement speed is equal to or greater than
    yours or your Pok\xE9mon\u2019s, they must roll 1d20 and add either their SPD
    modifier or half their relevant Speed Skill. If they surpass 10 + your ATK modifier,
    they successfully escape. Otherwise, they are unable to leave the encounter. Someone
    using the Run Away ability does not need to roll to escape regardless of their
    movement speed."
