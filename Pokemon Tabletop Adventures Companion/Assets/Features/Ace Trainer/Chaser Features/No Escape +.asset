  FeatureEffect: "When Pok\xE9mon or trainers try to flee during an encounter that
    you are participating in and their move-ment speed is equal to or greater than
    yours or your Pok\xE9mon\u2019s, they must roll 1d20 and add either their SPD
    modifier or half their relevant Speed Skill. If they surpass 15 + your ATK modifier,
    they successfully escape. Other-wise, they are unable to leave the encounter.
    Someone using the Run Away ability must roll to escape as if they did not have
    that ability. If the target successfully escapes, your movement speed as well
    as the movement speed of all your Pok\xE9mon increases by 4 meters per round for
    10 minutes if you try to pursue the escapee. Re-places No Escape."
